Christy M. White practices immigration law exclusively. Ms. White is the co-founder and managing partner of The Meshel Law Group, PLLC.

Ms. White was born and raised in Canton, Mississippi, an impoverished and underprivileged city. Eager not to become a statistic of the environment, she excelled in academia and developed a passion for liberating others. Therefore, at the age of 10 she knew she wanted to become an attorney.
Ms. White received her Juris Doctorate from The University of Mississippi.

After sitting for the Mississippi Bar, she ventured to Dallas, Texas to begin her career and discover her purpose. Shortly after arriving, she began clerking for Berry, Appleman, and Leiden, and after passing the Texas Bar, she continued to pursue an immigration career at Mathur Law Offices, P.C.
Ms. White focuses her practice on fighting for comprehensive immigration rights, and challenges herself to become a disruptive innovator for the U.S. immigration system. She believes in educating the community about unconstitutional immigration rights and empowering immigrant families to speak out.
