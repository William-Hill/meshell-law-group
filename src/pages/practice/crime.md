The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) created several options for immigrant victims abused at the hands of U.S. citizens and permanent residents. There are three primary categories of people who can qualify:

<br>

- Spouse – The spouse of an abusive husband or wife who is either a US citizen or a permanent resident will qualify. If a child is the direct victim of the abuse, you the parent can still apply for yourself and your children as long as they are unmarried and under 21 years old.
- Parent – Though less common, parents who are abused by their children may qualify under VAWA.
- Child – Children who are under 21 years of age and unmarried can file for themselves if they have been abused. In some cases, children between 21 and 25 years of age can still qualify as long as they only delayed filing directly because of the abuse.
