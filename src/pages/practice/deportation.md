Facing deportation from the United States is one of the most frightening things that can happen in someoneâ€™s life.
It is a very stressful, personal, and difficult process. It is important to find an attorney who can defend you in immigration court quickly.
Undocumented  immigrants, expired visa holders, and even lawful permanent residents can be  placed in deportation proceedings for many reasons.

**There are several ways to dispute a deportation including  some of the following:**

- Asylum/Withholding of Removal/Convention Against Torture
- Adjustment of Status
- Cancellation of Removal
- Motion to Reopen Deportation/Reconsider
- Waivers of Inadmissibility
- Terminating or Administratively closing removal proceedings
- Appeal of Deportation/Removal Order

- Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA)
- Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)
