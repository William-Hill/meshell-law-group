The first step is to file an immigrant visa petition. The immigrant visa petition for an alien relative can be filed at any time.

The Petitioner must show proof of U.S. citizenship or permanent residence and documentary evidence of the qualifying relationship to the Beneficiary.
<br>  
For a Preference category petition, once the Relative Petition is approved, the Application for Permanent Residence can be filed if visas are available.
Visas are always available for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens. *Beneficiaries under the preference system must wait until visas are available.  
<br>
*At the time the Application for Permanent Residence is filed, the Beneficiary can apply for work authorization and permission to travel outside the U.S. while the application is processing.
